Building smart classes


## Inspiration

The idea stemmed from me being a student, who takes online classes and can rarely connect with the professor or the teacher on a level I do in real life classes. Taking in consideration how Minerva Schools (A complete college online with classes taken via video) hosts their classes, I tried to build a prototype of a similar product, where the professor can see real time response of their students, hence helping him/her to judge what ways to communicate work and what don't.


## What it does

The app allows multiple students to join a class using a class ID (thanks to Agora.io !) and the professor can then click a button and judge the expressions of his/her students whenever they feel it is helpful to do so [button currently not working, as I couldn't figure out how to take a screenshot of the feed and send it to the backend]. This is particularly helpful when giving out assignments, suggesting something new and never-done-of-kind, and having long debates and discussions.

## How I built it

Using the Agora Web SDK !

## Challenges I ran into

oof, the whole app was built in under 6 hours (including coding, understanding the samples and documentation and testing), so I lost track of the challenges I had to face. That said, considering this is doable in such a small time-frame, it is definitely possible to build so much more into an app like this.

## What I learned

How kick-ass Agora is !
It's really simple getting started with building in video feeds using their SDK, and using it for the first time was unexpectedly smooth.

## What's next for Dapper-Stream

A lot !

first off, a better UI, login methods, and then comes the ability to run continuous emotion recognition on the frames to get a better and a seamless experience.

Additionally, considering Agora provides a chat API too, it should be fun integrating that into the app, to enable live communication via chat (as there should be in an online class).
